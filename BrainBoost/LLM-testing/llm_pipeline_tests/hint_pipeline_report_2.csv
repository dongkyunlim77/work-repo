While the logic and syntax appear sound, there is a potential performance issue when handling large lists due to repeated counting operations.",,,"[{'error_description': 'Repetitive use of `count()` inside the loop, resulting in inefficient performance, especially for large lists.', 'error_line': 3, 'error_severity_ranking': 1}]",HINT: Consider optimizing your solution by minimizing repeated operations inside loops.
