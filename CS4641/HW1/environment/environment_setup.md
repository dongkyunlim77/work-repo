# Environment Setup

1. Refer to the EdStem post about [VS Code and Anaconda Setup Guide](https://edstem.org/us/courses/62622/discussion/5175000) if you do not already have Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
2. Create a conda environment from the .yml files provided in `/environment` folder:
    - If you are running windows, use the Conda Prompt, on Mac or Linux you can just use the Terminal.
    - Use the command: `conda env create -f ml_hw1_env.yml`
    - This should create an environment named `ml_hw1`. 
3. Activate the conda environment:
    - Windows command: `activate ml_hw1` 
    - MacOS / Linux command: `conda activate ml_hw1`
4. Activating the environment does not gurantee the environment will be used when running Python applications. In VS Code, follow these steps:
    - Open the Jupyter notebook file
    - On the top right, click the button that states "Select Kernel"
    - Select "Python Environments..."
    - Select the ml_hw1 environment
