        <h1>Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech, and a hell of an engineer—
            A helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer.
            Like all the jolly good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear.
            I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.
            
            Oh! If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in White and Gold,
            And put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold.
            But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you what he'd do—
            He would yell, 'To hell with Georgia!' like his daddy used to do.
            
            Oh, I wish I had a barrel of rum and sugar three thousand pounds,
            A college bell to put it in and a clapper to stir it round.
            I'd drink to all the good fellows who come from far and near.
            I'm a ramblin', gamblin', hell of an engineer!
